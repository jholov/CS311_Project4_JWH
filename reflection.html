                                    The hardest part for me was definitely deciding what framework to use as it was difficult for me to understand exactly what it was doing.
                                    It was also overwhelming downloading the files and seeing all the different options it had. 
                                    I choose bootstrap because the website helped me understand how the grid system functioned.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    After I got semi used to the grid system, I was able to make the home page format pretty easily. 
                                    The next step I got stuck on was trying to make the Composer Name section and Biography section fit in the same column 
                                    after the List of Operas section.
                                    It kept placing the bio underneath the List section. 
                                    I first thought you had to use nested rows but the pictures on bootstraps website make it seem like it does something else. 
                                    I tried to incorporate it in anyway but since I didn’t really understand what it was doing, it didn’t work out. 
                                    After trying different things, I eventually went back to the nesting idea and google nesting and bootstrap and found a blog that helped explain it better. 
                                    It had test code that I could run and a diagram that I could use to replicate it and I was able to figure it out. 
                                    After messing around with that for a bit, I had a better understanding of where to create the nested row so it would function how I wanted it.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once I got that done, it was just inputting all the data provided into the columns I wanted and resizing them a bit to make it look better. I changed some of the font
                                    types and resize everything relatively easily and was surprised how effortlessly it was to incorporate a music player in each page. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Overall, I’m still kind of confused on using html and CSS frameworks as we haven’t done a whole lot with either of them so far. 
                                    It seems like a lot of CSS formats are very specific to one thing. 
                                    I can see how once you use one for a while and learn the ins and outs of it, it would make creating websites a lot more efficient though.
